If a supplier delivers a DMEPOS item without first receiving a WOPD, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer to the LCD-related Policy Article, located at the bottom of this policy under the Related Local Coverage Documents section.</p>\n<p>For DMEPOS base items that require a WOPD, and also require separately billed associated options, accessories, and/or supplies, the supplier must have received a WOPD which lists the base item and which may list all the associated options, accessories, and/or supplies that are separately billed prior to the delivery of the items. In this scenario, if the supplier separately bills for associated options, accessories, and/or supplies without first receiving a completed and signed WOPD of the base item prior to delivery, the claim(s) shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>An item/service is correctly coded when it meets all the coding guidelines listed in CMS HCPCS guidelines, LCDs, LCD-related Policy Articles, or DME MAC articles.

Proof of delivery documentation must be made available to the Medicare contractor upon request. All services that do not have appropriate proof of delivery from the supplier shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.<br><br>REFILL REQUIREMENTS<br><br>For DMEPOS items and supplies provided on a recurring basis, billing must be based on prospective, not retrospective use. For DMEPOS products that are supplied as refills to the original order, suppliers must contact the beneficiary prior to dispensing the refill and not automatically ship on a pre-determined basis, even if authorized by the beneficiary. This shall be done to ensure that the refilled item remains reasonable and necessary, existing supplies are approaching exhaustion, and to confirm any changes or modifications to the order. Contact with the beneficiary or designee regarding refills must take place no sooner than 14 calendar days prior to the delivery/shipping date. For delivery of refills, the supplier must deliver the DMEPOS product no sooner than 10 calendar days prior to the end of usage for the current product. This is regardless of which delivery method is utilized.<br><br>For all DMEPOS items that are provided on a recurring basis, suppliers are required to have contact with the beneficiary or caregiver/designee prior to dispensing a new supply of items. Suppliers must not deliver refills without a refill request from a beneficiary. Items delivered without a valid, documented refill request will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.<br><br>Suppliers must not dispense a quantity of supplies exceeding a beneficiary's expected utilization. Suppliers must stay attuned to changed or atypical utilization patterns on the part of their clients. Suppliers must verify with the treating practitioners that any changed or atypical utilization is warranted. <br><br>Regardless of utilization, a supplier must not dispense more than a three (3) - month quantity at a time.<br><br>DRUG WASTAGE<br><br>Claims for drugs billed to Medicare must use drug dosage formulations and/or unit dose sizes that minimize wastage. Medicare provides payment for the amount of a single use vial or other single use package of drug or biological discarded, in addition to the dose administered.

Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 Pressure Injury: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis<br>Partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).</p>\n<p>Stage 3 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin loss<br>Full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.</p>\n<p>Stage 4 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.</p>\n<p>Unstageable Pressure Injury: Obscured full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar. If slough or eschar is removed, a Stage 3 or Stage 4 pressure injury will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e. dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed.</p>\n<p>Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration <br>Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4). Do not use DTPI to describe vascular, traumatic, neuropathic, or dermatologic conditions.</p>\n<p><br>UTILIZATION GUIDELINES</p>\n<p>Refer to Coverage Indications, Limitations and/or Medical Necessity</p>",

It does not include oximetry results done as part of other overnight testing such as polysomnography or home sleep testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Refer to the Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Devices for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (L33718) LCD for information on sleep tests used for the diagnosis of sleep apnea.</p>\n<p>The qualifying blood gas study must be one that complies with the Fiscal Intermediary, Local Carrier, or A/B Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) policy on the standards for conducting the test and is covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. This includes a requirement that the test be performed by a provider who is qualified to bill Medicare for the test – i.e., a Part A provider, a laboratory, an Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF), or a treating practitioner. A supplier is not considered a qualified provider or a qualified laboratory for purposes of this policy. Blood gas studies performed by a supplier are not acceptable. In addition, the qualifying blood gas study may not be paid for by any supplier. These prohibitions do not extend to blood gas studies performed by a hospital certified to do such tests.</p>\n<p>The qualifying blood gas study may be performed while the beneficiary is on oxygen as long as the reported blood gas values meet the Group I or Group II criteria.</p>\n<p>When both arterial blood gas (ABG) and oximetry tests have been performed on the same day under the same conditions (i.e., at rest/awake, during exercise, or during sleep), the ABG result will be used to determine if the coverage criteria were met. If an ABG test done at rest and awake is non-qualifying, but either an exercise or sleep oximetry test on the same day is qualifying, the exercise or oximetry test result will determine coverage.</p>\n<p>All oxygen qualification testing must be performed in-person by a treating practitioner or other medical professional qualified to conduct oximetry testing. With the exception of overnight oximetry (see below), unsupervised or remotely supervised home testing does not qualify as a valid test for purposes of Medicare reimbursement of home oxygen and oxygen equipment.</p>\n<p>Exercise testing:</p>\n<p>When oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment is covered based on an oximetry study obtained during exercise, there must be documentation of three (3) oximetry studies in the beneficiary’s medical record:</p>\n<p>(1) Testing at rest without oxygen; and,</p>\n<p>(2) Testing during exercise without oxygen; and,</p>\n<p>(3) Testing during exercise with oxygen applied (to demonstrate the improvement of the hypoxemia).</p>\n<p>All 3 tests must be performed within the same testing session. Exercise testing must be performed in-person by a treating practitioner or other medical professional qualified to conduct exercise oximetry testing. Unsupervised or remotely supervised home exercise testing does not qualify as a valid test for purposes of Medicare reimbursement of home oxygen and oxygen equipment. Only the testing during exercise without oxygen (#2 above) is used for qualification.&nbsp;All 3 test results must be available upon request.</p>\n<p>Oximetry obtained after exercise while resting, sometimes referred to as “recovery” testing, is not part of the 3 required test elements and is not valid for determining eligibility for oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment coverage.</p>\n<p>Overnight Oximetry Studies:</p>\n<p>Overnight sleep oximetry may be performed in a facility or at home. For home overnight oximetry studies, the oximeter provided to the beneficiary must be tamper-proof and must have the capability to download data that allows documentation of the duration of oxygen desaturation below a specified value.</p>\n<p>Baseline saturation is defined as the mean saturation level during the duration of the test. For purposes of meeting criterion 3 described in Group I above there must be a minimum of 2 hours test time recorded for sleep oximetry. The result must reach a qualifying test value.</p>\n<p>Home overnight oximetry is limited solely to stand-alone overnight pulse oximetry performed in the beneficiary’s home under the conditions specified below. Overnight oximetry performed as part of home sleep testing or as part of any other home testing is not considered to be eligible under this provision to be used for qualification for reimbursement of home oxygen and oxygen equipment even if the testing was performed in compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>\n<p>Beneficiaries may self-administer home based overnight oximetry tests under the direction of a Medicare-enrolled Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF). A DME supplier or another shipping entity may deliver a pulse oximetry test unit and related technology to a beneficiary’s home under the following circumstances:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>The beneficiary’s treating practitioner has contacted the IDTF to order an overnight pulse oximetry test before the test is performed.</li>\n<li>The test is performed under the direction and/or instruction of a Medicare-approved IDTF. Because it is the beneficiary who self-administers this test, the IDTF must provide clear written instructions to the beneficiary on proper operation of the test equipment and must include access to the IDTF in order to address other concerns that may arise. The DME supplier may not create this written instruction, provide verbal instructions, answer questions from the beneficiary, apply or demonstrate the application of the testing equipment to the beneficiary, or otherwise participate in the conduct of the test.</li>\n<li>The test unit is sealed and tamper-proof such that test results cannot be accessed by anyone other than the IDTF which is responsible for transmitting a test report to the treating practitioner. The DME supplier may use related technology to download test results from the testing unit and transmit those results to the IDTF. In no case may the DME supplier access or manipulate the test results in any form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The IDTF must send the test results to the treating practitioner. The IDTF may send the test results to the supplier if the supplier is currently providing or has an order to provide oxygen or other respiratory services to the beneficiary or if the beneficiary has signed a release permitting the supplier to receive the report.</p>\n<p>Oximetry test results obtained through a similar process as described for home overnight oximetry (see above) while the beneficiary is awake, either at rest or with exercise, may not be used for purposes of qualifying the beneficiary for home oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment.</p>\n<p>Overnight oximetry does not include oximetry obtained during polysomnography or other sleep testing for sleep apnea, regardless of the location the testing was performed. See below for information on sleep testing that may be used to qualify for oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment coverage.</p>\n<p>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), Polysomnography and Home Sleep Tests:</p>\n<p>Some beneficiaries may require the simultaneous use of home oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment with a PAP device. To be considered for simultaneous coverage, all requirements in the \"Coverage Indications, Limitations and/or Medical Necessity\" sections of both the Oxygen and Oxygen Equipment and Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Devices for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea LCDs must be met. Consequently, in addition to this LCD, suppliers should refer to the Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Devices for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea LCD and related Policy Article for additional coverage, coding and documentation requirements.</p>\n<p>In the case of OSA, it is required that the OSA be appropriately and sufficiently treated before oxygen saturation results obtained during sleep testing are considered qualifying for oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment (see Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Devices for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea LCD for additional information).</p>\n<p>For beneficiaries with OSA, this means that the OSA must be sufficiently treated such that the underlying condition resulting in hypoxemia is unmasked. This must be demonstrated before oxygen saturation results obtained during polysomnography are considered qualifying for oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment.</p>\n<p>For beneficiaries with OSA, a qualifying oxygen saturation test may only occur during a titration polysomnographic study (either split night or stand-alone). The titration PSG is one in which all of the following criteria are met:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The titration is conducted over a minimum of two (2) hours; and,</li>\n<li>During titration:\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n<li>The AHI/RDI is reduced to less than or equal to an average of ten (10) events per hour; or,</li>\n<li>If the initial AHI/RDI was less than an average of ten (10) events per hour, the titration demonstrates further reduction in the AHI/RDI; and,</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Nocturnal oximetry conducted for the purpose of oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment reimbursement qualification may only be performed after optimal PAP settings have been determined and the beneficiary is using the PAP device at those settings; and,</li>\n<li>The nocturnal oximetry conducted during the PSG demonstrates an oxygen saturation of ≤ 88%.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be eligible for Medicare coverage and payment for home oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment for concurrent use with PAP therapy, the beneficiary must meet all other coverage requirements for oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment. Beneficiaries that qualify for oxygen therapy and oxygen equipment based on testing conducted only during the course of a sleep test are eligible only for reimbursement of stationary equipment.</p>\n<p>Overnight oximetry performed as part of home sleep testing or as part of any other home testing is not considered as eligible to be used for qualification for reimbursement of home oxygen and oxygen equipment (see the \"Overnight Oximetry Studies\" section above for additional information).</p>\n<p>Claims for oxygen equipment and supplies for beneficiaries who do not meet the coverage requirements for home oxygen therapy will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>PORTABLE OXYGEN SYSTEMS:</p>\n<p>A portable oxygen system is covered if the beneficiary is mobile within the home for Groups I and II, and the qualifying blood gas study was performed while at rest (awake) or during exercise. If the only qualifying blood gas study was performed during sleep, portable oxygen will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>If coverage criteria are met, a portable oxygen system is usually separately payable in addition to the stationary system. See exception in the LCD-related Policy Article Non-Medical Necessity Coverage and Payment Rules, OXYGEN EQUIPMENT, Initial 36-Months section.</p>\n<p>If a portable oxygen system is covered, the supplier must provide whatever quantity of oxygen the beneficiary uses; Medicare’s reimbursement is the same, regardless of the quantity of oxygen dispensed.</p>\n<p>LITER FLOW GREATER THAN 4 LPM:</p>\n<p>If initial oxygen coverage criteria for Group I, II or III have been met, a higher allowance for a stationary system for a flow rate of greater than 4 liters per minute (LPM) will be paid. For Group I or II, coverage greater than 4 LPM requires <span style=\"line-height: 107%;\">a qualifying </span>blood gas study performed while the beneficiary is on 4 or more LPM. If a flow rate greater than 4 LPM is billed and the coverage criterion for the higher allowance is not met, payment will be limited to the standard fee schedule allowance. (Refer to the LCD-related Policy Article for additional information on payment for greater than 4 LPM oxygen.)</p>\n<p>MISCELLANEOUS:</p>\n<p>Oxygen reimbursement is a bundled payment. All options, supplies and accessories are considered included in the monthly rental payment for oxygen equipment. Oxygen rental is billed using the appropriate code for the provided oxygen equipment. Separately billed options, accessories or supply items will be denied as unbundling.</p>\n<p>Emergency or stand-by oxygen systems for beneficiaries who are not regularly using oxygen will be denied as not reasonable and necessary since they are precautionary and not therapeutic in nature.</p>\n<p>Topical hyperbaric oxygen chambers (A4575) will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Topical oxygen delivery systems (E0446) will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>REFILLS OF OXYGEN CONTENTS:</p>\n<p>For Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) items and supplies provided on a recurring basis, billing must be based on prospective, not retrospective use.</p>\n<p>Oxygen contents are reimbursed with a monthly allowance covering all contents necessary for the month. Supply allowances are not subject to the refill monitoring and documentation requirements specified in Chapter 5 of the Medicare Program Integrity Manual.</p>\n<p>All other supplies, e.g. tubing, masks or cannulas, etc., are included in the monthly rental payment. Supplies that are not separately payable are not subject to the refill monitoring and documentation requirements specified in Chapter 5 of the Medicare Program Integrity Manual.</p>\n<p>See the Non-Medical Coverage and Payment Rules section of the LCD-related Policy Article for additional information about coverage of oxygen contents.</p>\n<p>GENERAL</p>\n<p>A Standard Written Order (SWO) must be communicated to the supplier before a claim is submitted. If the supplier bills for an item addressed in this policy without first receiving a completed SWO, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>For Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) base items that require a Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD), the supplier must have received a signed SWO before the DMEPOS item is delivered to a beneficiary. If a supplier delivers a DMEPOS item without first receiving a WOPD, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer to the LCD-related Policy Article, located at the bottom of this policy under the Related Local Coverage Documents section.</p>\n<p>For DMEPOS base items that require a WOPD, and also require separately billed associated options, accessories, and/or supplies, the supplier must have received a WOPD which lists the base item and which may list all the associated options, accessories, and/or supplies that are separately billed prior to the delivery of the items. In this scenario, if the supplier separately bills for associated options, accessories, and/or supplies without first receiving a completed and signed WOPD of the base item prior to delivery, the claim(s) shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>An item/service is correctly coded when it meets all the coding guidelines listed in CMS HCPCS guidelines, LCDs, LCD-related Policy Articles, or DME MAC articles. Claims that do not meet coding guidelines shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary/incorrectly coded.</p>\n<p>Proof of delivery (POD) is a Supplier Standard and DMEPOS suppliers are required to maintain POD documentation in their files. Proof of delivery documentation must be made available to the Medicare contractor upon request. All services that do not have appropriate proof of delivery from the supplier shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p></span>\n\t\t\t\t"

Providers must use care because the treatment of lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency with ulceration and complications related to the treatment of these conditions by use of PCDs, commonly require consideration of diagnoses and management of systemic conditions. In no event should a provider order PCDs or PCD appliances that are to be used for or are to be applied to areas of the body that fall outside of their state scope of practice and other license limitations.</p>\n<p>DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p>For Medicare DMEPOS reimbursement purposes the following definitions are used in this policy.</p>\n<p>Edema:</p>\n<p>Edema is a non-specific term for the accumulation of fluid in tissue, most often in the extremities. There are numerous causes for edema, ranging from systemic disorders (e.g. congestive heart failure) to local conditions (e.g. post-surgery, congenital abnormalities). (Examples are not all-inclusive.)</p>\n<p>Lymphedema, as discussed below, is just one group of conditions that can be a cause of accumulation of fluid in the tissue. Lymphedema arises from disorders of the lymphatic system. It is essential to rule out other causes of edema in order to diagnose lymphedema. Edema from other causes is not classified as lymphedema for purposes of Medicare reimbursement for PCDs (E0650, E0651, E0652).</p>\n<p>Primary lymphedema:</p>\n<p>Primary lymphedema is a disorder of the lymphatic system that occurs on its own. It is inherited and uncommon. Examples (not all-inclusive) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Congenital lymphedema due to lymphatic aplasia or hypoplasia</li>\n<li>Milroy's disease, an autosomal dominant familial form of congenital lymphedema</li>\n<li>Lymphedema praecox</li>\n<li>Lymphedema tarda</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secondary lymphedema:</p>\n<p>Secondary lymphedema is a disorder of lymphatic flow that is caused by some other disease or condition. It is more common than primary lymphedema. It is most commonly caused by surgery (especially lymph node dissection, such as for breast cancer), radiation therapy (especially axillary or inguinal), trauma, lymphatic obstruction by tumor, and, in developing countries, lymphatic filariasis. Secondary lymphedema may also result from compression of the lymphatic and venous channels resulting from leakage of fluid into interstitial tissues in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). (See below)</p>\n<p>Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)</p>\n<p>Lymphedema may also be caused by CVI when fluid leaks into the tissues from the venous system. CVI of the lower extremities is a condition caused by abnormalities of the venous wall and valves, leading to obstruction or reflux of blood flow in the veins. Signs of CVI include hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, chronic edema, and venous stasis ulcers. The incidence of lymphedema from CVI is not well established.<br><br>Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)</p>\n<p>PAD is a circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to limbs, resulting in compromised blood flow to the distal tissue and failure to keep up with oxygen demands.</p>\n<p>GENERAL</p>\n<p>PCDs coded as E0650, E0651, E0652 are used only in the treatment of lymphedema or CVI with venous stasis ulcers. Reimbursement for these items is based upon the criteria in the following sections. PCD coded as E0675 is used in the treatment of PAD. Claims for E0675 will be denied as not reasonable and necessary as outlined below.</p>\n<p>I - LYMPHEDEMA</p>\n<p>A PCD coded as E0650 or E0651 is covered for both primary and secondary lymphedema in beneficiaries with chronic and severe lymphedema when all of the following three requirements are met:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The beneficiary has a diagnosis of lymphedema as defined above, and</li>\n<li>The beneficiary has persistence of chronic and severe lymphedema as identified by the documented presence of at least one of the following clinical findings:\n<ul>\n<li>Marked hyperkeratosis with hyperplasia and hyperpigmentation,</li>\n<li>Papillomatosis cutis lymphostatica,</li>\n<li>Deformity of elephantiasis,</li>\n<li>Skin breakdown with persisting lymphorrhea,</li>\n<li>Detailed measurements over time confirming the persistence of the lymphedema with a history evidencing a likely etiology, and</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In addition to this documented persistence, the lymphedema is then documented to be unresponsive to other clinical treatment over the course of a required four-week trial. (See below for trial guidelines.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A PCD coded as E0650 or E0651 used to treat lymphedema that does not meet all of the requirements above is not eligible for reimbursement. Claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>A PCD coded as E0650 or E0651 used to treat edema from causes other than lymphedema is not eligible for reimbursement. Claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>A PCD coded as E0652 is not covered for the treatment of lymphedema of the extremities alone even if the criteria in this section are met. Claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer below to the sections III - LYMPHEDEMA EXTENDING ONTO THE CHEST, TRUNK AND/OR ABDOMEN and PCD Code Selection for additional information about the limited coverage for PCD coded as E0652.</p>\n<p>Four-Week Trial for Lymphedema</p>\n<p>A four-week trial of conservative therapy demonstrating failed response to treatment is required. The four-week trial of conservative therapy must include all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular and compliant use of an appropriate compression bandage system or compression garment to provide adequate graduated compression\n<ul>\n<li>Adequate compression is defined as (1) sufficient pressure at the lowest pressure point to cause fluid movement, and (2) sufficient pressure across the gradient (from highest to lowest pressure point) to move fluid from distal to proximal.

Claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>A PCD coded as E0652 is not covered for the treatment of CVI even if the criteria in this section are met. Claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer below to the sections III - LYMPHEDEMA EXTENDING ONTO THE CHEST, TRUNK AND/OR ABDOMEN and PCD Code Selection for additional information about the limited coverage for PCD coded as E0652.</p>\n<p>Six-Month Trial for CVI</p>\n<p>A six-month trial of conservative therapy demonstrating failed response to treatment is required. The six-month trial of conservative therapy must include all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliant use of an appropriate compression bandage system or compression garment to provide adequate graduated compression\n<ul>\n<li>Adequate compression is defined as (1) sufficient pressure at the lowest pressure point to cause fluid movement and (2) sufficient pressure across the gradient (from highest to lowest pressure point) to move fluid from distal to proximal.

Where improvement has occurred, the trial of conservative therapy must be continued with subsequent reassessments. When no significant improvement has occurred for a continuous period of six months and the coverage criteria above are still met, then the use of a PCD to treat CVI is eligible for reimbursement.</p>\n<p>The trial of conservative therapy must be documented in the beneficiary’s medical record before prescribing any type of PCD (E0650, E0651, E0652).

If the supplier does not receive the order/prescription for the base item prior to delivery, the claim will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>The WOPD for the base item may only be written after the completion of the face-to-face encounter requirements. Pursuant to the Social Security Act, Title XVIII, §1834(a)(1)(E)(iv), the treating practitioner who completes the face-to-face requirements must be the same practitioner who writes the order/prescription for the PMD (base item).</p>\n<p>A supplier may provide a template to the treating practitioner for their use in creating the WOPD for the base item. Such a template may list the elements of a WOPD, but the supplier must not fill in or complete any of these elements.</p>\n<p>An SWO is required prior to claim submission for all options, accessories, and/or supplies that are separately billed in addition to the base.

Even if the treating practitioner completes this type of form and puts it in his/her chart, this supplier-generated form is <u> not</u> a substitute for the comprehensive medical record as noted above. Suppliers are encouraged to help educate practitioners on the type of information that is needed to document a beneficiary's mobility needs.<br><br>Practitioners shall also provide reports of pertinent laboratory tests, x-rays, and/or other diagnostic tests (e.g., pulmonary function tests, cardiac stress test, electromyogram, etc.) performed in the course of management of the beneficiary. Upon request, suppliers shall provide notes from prior visits to give a historical perspective of the progression of disease over time and to corroborate the information in the face-to-face encounter.<br><br>If the report of a licensed/certified medical professional (LCMP) examination is to be considered as part of the face-to-face encounter (see Policy Article), there must be a signed and dated attestation by the supplier or LCMP that the LCMP has no financial relationship with the supplier. (Note: Evaluations performed by an LCMP who has a financial relationship with the supplier may be submitted to provide additional clinical information, but will not be considered as part of the face-to-face encounter by the treating practitioner.)<br><br>Although beneficiaries who qualify for coverage of a power mobility device may use that device outside the home, because Medicare’s coverage of a wheelchair or POV is determined solely by the beneficiary’s mobility needs within the home, the encounter must clearly distinguish the beneficiary’s abilities and needs within the home from any additional needs for use outside the home.<br><br>SPECIALTY EVALUATION:<br><br>The specialty evaluation that is required for beneficiary's who receive a Group 2 Single Power Option or Multiple Power Options PWC, any Group 3 PWC, or a push-rim activated power assist device is in addition to the requirement for the face-to-face encounter. The specialty evaluation provides detailed information explaining why each specific option or accessory – i.e., power seating system, alternate drive control interface, or push-rim activated power assist – is needed to address the beneficiary’s mobility limitation. There must be a written report of this evaluation available on request.<br><br>HOME ASSESSMENT:<br><br>Prior to or at the time of delivery of a POV or PWC, the supplier or practitioner must perform an on-site evaluation of the beneficiary’s home to verify that the beneficiary can adequately maneuver the device that is provided considering physical layout, doorway width, doorway thresholds, and surfaces.

Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury.<br><br>Stage 2 Pressure Injury: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis<br>Partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).<br><br>Stage 3 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin loss<br>Full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.<br><br>Stage 4 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location.

If slough or eschar is removed, a Stage 3 or Stage 4 pressure injury will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e. dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed.<br><br>Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4).

Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury.<br><br>Stage 2 Pressure Injury: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis<br>Partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).<br><br>Stage 3 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin loss<br>Full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.<br><br>Stage 4 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.<br><br>Unstageable Pressure Injury: Obscured full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar. If slough or eschar is removed, a Stage 3 or Stage 4 pressure injury will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e. dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed.<br><br>Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4).

These ventilator-related disease groups overlap conditions described in this Respiratory Assist Devices LCD used to determine coverage for bi-level PAP devices. Each of these disease categories are conditions where the specific presentation of the disease can vary from beneficiary to beneficiary. For conditions such as these, the specific treatment plan for any individual beneficiary will vary as well. Choice of an appropriate treatment plan, including the determination to use a ventilator vs. a bi-level PAP device, is made based upon the specifics of each individual beneficiary's medical condition. In the event of a claim review, there must be sufficient detailed information in the medical record to justify the treatment selected.</p>\n<p>Ventilators fall under the Frequent and Substantial Servicing (FSS) payment category, and payment policy requirements preclude FSS payment for devices used to deliver continuous and/or intermittent positive airway pressure, regardless of the illness treated by the device. (Social Security Act 1834(a)(3)(A)) This means that products currently classified as HCPCS code E0465, E0466, or E0467 when used to provide CPAP or bi-level PAP (with or without backup rate) therapy, regardless of the underlying medical condition, shall not be paid in the FSS payment category. A ventilator is not eligible for reimbursement for any of the conditions described in this RAD LCD even though the ventilator equipment may have the capability of operating in a bi-level PAP (E0470, E0471) mode. Claims for ventilators used to provide CPAP or bi-level CPAP therapy for conditions described in this RAD policy will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>General principles of correct coding require that products assigned to a specific HCPCS code only be billed using the assigned code. Thus, using the HCPCS codes for CPAP (E0601) or bi-level PAP (E0470, E0471) devices for a ventilator (E0465, E0466, or E0467) used to provide CPAP or bi-level PAP therapy is incorrect coding. Claims for ventilators billed using the CPAP or bi-level PAP device HCPCS codes will be denied as incorrect coding.</p>\n<p>CONTINUED COVERAGE CRITERIA FOR E0470 AND E0471 DEVICES BEYOND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THERAPY</p>\n<p>Beneficiaries covered for the first three months of an E0470 or an E0471 device must be re-evaluated to establish the medical necessity of continued coverage by Medicare beyond the first three months. While the beneficiary may certainly need to be evaluated at earlier intervals after this therapy is initiated, the re-evaluation upon which Medicare will base a decision to continue coverage beyond this time must occur no sooner than 61 days after initiating therapy by the treating practitioner. Medicare will not continue coverage for the fourth and succeeding months of therapy until this re-evaluation has been completed.</p>\n<p>There must be documentation in the beneficiary’s medical record about the progress of relevant symptoms and beneficiary usage of the device up to that time. Failure of the beneficiary to be consistently using the E0470 or E0471 device for an average of 4 hours per 24 hour period by the time of the re-evaluation (on or after 61 days after initiation of therapy) would represent non-compliant utilization for the intended purposes and expectations of benefit of this therapy. This would constitute reason for Medicare to deny continued coverage as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>A signed and dated statement completed by the treating practitioner no sooner than 61 days after initiating use of the device, declaring that the beneficiary is compliantly using the device (an average of 4 hours per 24 hour period) and that the beneficiary is benefiting from its use must be obtained by the supplier of the device for continued coverage beyond three months.</p>\n<p>If the above criteria are not met, continued coverage of an E0470 or an E0471 device and related accessories will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>ACCESSORIES</p>\n<p>The following table represents the usual maximum amount of accessories expected to be reasonable and necessary:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Use of a gastric suction pump for other conditions will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Supplies (tubing, tape, dressings, etc.) are covered and are separately payable when they are medically necessary and used with a medically necessary E2000 pump. Supplies used with DME that is denied as not reasonable and necessary will also be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>RESPIRATORY SUCTION</p>\n<p>A respiratory suction pump (E0600) is only covered for beneficiaries who have difficulty raising and clearing secretions secondary to:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Cancer or surgery of the throat or mouth</li>\n<li>Dysfunction of the swallowing muscles</li>\n<li>Unconsciousness or obtunded state</li>\n<li>Tracheostomy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use of a respiratory suction pump for other conditions will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Suction catheters (A4605, A4624, A4628) and sterile water/saline (A4216, A4217) are covered and are separately payable when they are medically necessary and used with a medically necessary E0600 pump. Supplies used with DME that is denied as not reasonable and necessary will also be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Codes A4605 and A4624 are only covered for beneficiaries with a tracheostomy. Refer to the ICD-10 code list in the LCD-related Policy Article for applicable diagnoses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracheal suction catheters (A4624) are reasonable and necessary only when all of the following are met:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>The beneficiary has a tracheostomy.</li>\n<li>The beneficiary requires the use of a covered respiratory suction pump (E0600) as described above, for tracheostomy suctioning.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Closed system catheters (A4605) are reasonable and necessary only when all of the following are met:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>The beneficiary has a tracheostomy.</li>\n<li>The beneficiary requires the use of a covered respiratory suction pump (E0600) as described above, for tracheostomy suctioning.</li>\n<li>The beneficiary requires the use of a covered ventilator.

The oropharynx is not sterile, therefore the catheter can be reused if properly cleansed and/or disinfected. More than three catheters (A4628) per week will be denied as not reasonable and necessary for oropharyngeal suctioning.</p>\n<p>A7047 is not used to remove secretions for the covered indications described above. Claims for A7047 will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Sterile water/saline solution (A4216, A4217) is covered when used to clear a suction catheter after tracheostomy suctioning. Sterile water/saline will be denied as not reasonable and necessary when used for oropharyngeal suctioning.</p>\n<p>WOUND SUCTION</p>\n<p>Use of suction on wounds (A9272, K0743) is only appropriate in those clinical scenarios where the quantity of exudate exceeds the capacity of conservative measures such as surgical dressings and wound fillers to contain it. However, wound suction to remove exudate can be accomplished with the use of non-covered disposable, suction devices (A9272) or with covered DME devices (K0743). When a non-covered alternative exists (A9272), it is not reasonable or necessary to use a covered DME item (K0743). Therefore, when K0743 is billed it will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer to the related Local Coverage Policy Article for Suction Pumps for additional information about the statutory requirements for disposable wound suction items (A9270, A9272).</p>\n<p>Wound suction pumps and their associated supplies, which have not been specifically designated as being qualified to use HCPCS code K0743 via written instructions from the Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding (PDAC) Contractor will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Supplies (dressings, tubing, etc.) are covered and are separately payable when they are medically necessary and used with a medically necessary K0743 pump. Supplies used with DME that is denied as not reasonable and necessary will also be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>GENERAL</p>\n<p>A Standard Written Order (SWO) must be communicated to the supplier before a claim is submitted. If the supplier bills for an item addressed in this policy without first receiving a completed SWO, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>For Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) base items that require a Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD), the supplier must have received a signed SWO before the DMEPOS item is delivered to a beneficiary. If a supplier delivers a DMEPOS item without first receiving a WOPD, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer to the LCD-related Policy Article, located at the bottom of this policy under the Related Local Coverage Documents section.</p>\n<p>For DMEPOS base items that require a WOPD, and also require separately billed associated options, accessories, and/or supplies, the supplier must have received a WOPD which lists the base item and which may list all the associated options, accessories, and/or supplies that are separately billed prior to the delivery of the items. In this scenario, if the supplier separately bills for associated options, accessories, and/or supplies without first receiving a completed and signed WOPD of the base item prior to delivery, the claim(s) shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>An item/service is correctly coded when it meets all the coding guidelines listed in CMS HCPCS guidelines, LCDs, LCD-related Policy Articles, or DME MAC articles. Claims that do not meet coding guidelines shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary/incorrectly coded.</p>\n<p>Proof of delivery (POD) is a Supplier Standard and DMEPOS suppliers are required to maintain POD documentation in their files. Proof of delivery documentation must be made available to the Medicare contractor upon request. All services that do not have appropriate proof of delivery from the supplier shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>REFILL REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p>For DMEPOS items and supplies provided on a recurring basis, billing must be based on prospective, not retrospective use. For DMEPOS products that are supplied as refills to the original order, suppliers must contact the beneficiary prior to dispensing the refill and not automatically ship on a pre-determined basis, even if authorized by the beneficiary. This shall be done to ensure that the refilled item remains reasonable and necessary, existing supplies are approaching exhaustion, and to confirm any changes or modifications to the order. Contact with the beneficiary or designee regarding refills must take place no sooner than 14 calendar days prior to the delivery/shipping date. For delivery of refills, the supplier must deliver the DMEPOS product no sooner than 10 calendar days prior to the end of usage for the current product. This is regardless of which delivery method is utilized.</p>\n<p>For all DMEPOS items that are provided on a recurring basis, suppliers are required to have contact with the beneficiary or caregiver/designee prior to dispensing a new supply of items. Suppliers must not deliver refills without a refill request from a beneficiary. Items delivered without a valid, documented refill request will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Suppliers must not dispense a quantity of supplies exceeding a beneficiary's expected utilization. Suppliers must stay attuned to changed or atypical utilization patterns on the part of their clients. Suppliers must verify with the treating practitioners that any changed or atypical utilization is warranted.</p>\n<p>Regardless of utilization, a supplier must not dispense more than a 3-month quantity at a time.</p></span>\n\t\t\t\t"

Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 Pressure Injury: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis<br>Partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).</p>\n<p>Stage 3 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin loss<br>Full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.</p>\n<p>Stage 4 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.</p>\n<p>Unstageable Pressure Injury: Obscured full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br>Full-thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar. If slough or eschar is removed, a Stage 3 or Stage 4 pressure injury will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e. dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed.</p>\n<p>Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood-filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4).

They are considered reasonable and necessary when used as described by this policy. Medicare limits reimbursement to items that have sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate that use of the item is safe and effective (see Medicare Program Integrity Manual, Chapter 13). Materials that lack sufficient clinical evidence are not recognized as effective and are not considered reasonable and necessary. The safety and effectiveness of the following materials have not been established:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Balsam of Peru in castor oil</li>\n<li>Iodine – other than iodoform gauze packing</li>\n<li>Carbon Fiber</li>\n<li>Charcoal</li>\n<li>Copper</li>\n<li>Honey</li>\n<li>Silver</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above list is not exhaustive. Any material other than the materials explicitly listed among the reimbursable dressing types discussed above (i.e., alginate, collagen, foam, gauze, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, etc.) is not considered reasonable and necessary until sufficient credible clinical evidence is available to justify inclusion of the material into this policy as a reimbursable surgical dressing component.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: normal;\">Dressings containing multiple components are classified based upon the clinically predominant component. Multi-component dressings predominantly comprised of materials not recognized as effective are not considered reasonable and necessary even if there is some minor proportion of effective materials included in the composition of the complete product. Claims for surgical dressings composed predominantly of materials not listed as reimbursable in the policy will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: normal;\">Refer to the related Surgical Dressings Policy Article CODING GUIDELINES for information regarding the coding of dressings made of multiple materials.</p>\n<p><strong><br>MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>\n<p><br>Surgical dressings are covered for as long as they are reasonable and necessary. Dressings over a percutaneous catheter or tube (e.g., intravascular, epidural, nephrostomy, etc.) are covered as long as the catheter or tube remains in place and after removal until the wound heals. Dressings used over a percutaneous catheter or tube may be included in supply allowances associated with other policies. In this situation, there is no separate coverage under this LCD. (Refer to the related Surgical Dressings Policy Article CODING GUIDELINES).</p>\n<p>When a wound cover with an adhesive border is being used, no other dressing is needed on top of it and additional tape is not required. Reasons for use of additional tape must be well documented.</p>\n<p>Use of more than one type of wound filler or more than one type of wound cover in a single wound is not reasonable and necessary. The exception is a primary dressing composed of: (1) an alginate or other fiber gelling dressing; or, (2) a saline, water, or hydrogel impregnated gauze dressing. Either of these might need an additional wound cover.</p>\n<p>It is not appropriate to use combinations of a hydrating dressing on the same wound at the same time as an absorptive dressing (e.g., hydrogel and alginate).</p>\n<p>The frequency of recommended dressing changes depends on the type and use of the surgical dressing. When combinations of primary dressings, secondary dressings, and wound filler are used, the change frequencies of the individual products should be similar. For purposes of this policy, the product in contact with the wound determines the change frequency. It is not reasonable and necessary to use a combination of products with differing change intervals. For example, it is not reasonable and necessary to use a secondary dressing with a weekly change frequency over a primary dressing with a daily change interval. Such claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>It is not reasonable and necessary to use a secondary dressing with primary dressings that contain an impervious backing layer with or without and adhesive border.</p>\n<p>Dressing size must be based on and appropriate to the size of the wound. For wound covers, the pad size is usually about 2 inches greater than the dimensions of the wound. For example, a 2 in. x 2 in. wound requires a 4 in. x 4 in. pad size.</p>\n<p>The quantity and type of dressings dispensed at any one time must take into account the status of the wound(s), the likelihood of change, and the recent use of dressings.</p>\n<p>Dressing needs may change frequently (e.g., weekly) in the early phases of wound treatment and/or with heavily draining wounds. Suppliers are required to monitor the quantity of dressings that the beneficiary is actually using and to adjust their provision of dressings accordingly. Refer to the REFILL REQUIREMENTS section for additional information.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: normal;\">Surgical dressings must be tailored to the specific needs of an individual beneficiary. When surgical dressings are provided in kits, only those components of the kit that meet the definition of a surgical dressing, that are ordered by the treating practitioner, and that are reasonable and necessary are covered.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 11.5pt;\"><strong><br>GENERAL</strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 120%;\"><br>A Standard Written Order (SWO) must be communicated to the supplier before a claim is submitted.

Arthritis due to other etiologies such as rheumatoid disease, gout, psoriasis, etc. (not all-inclusive) is not included by the use of these terms.</p>\n<p>Transcutaneous electrical joint stimulation is administered by a noninvasive device that delivers electrical stimulation intended to reduce the level of pain and symptoms associated with arthritis in a joint. Devices that provide electrical stimulation have considerable variation in the parameters of the current, how the current is applied, etc. This LCD is applicable regardless of the individual characteristics of any given device.</p>\n<p>INDICATIONS</p>\n<p>There is insufficient published clinical evidence to establish that treatment with&nbsp;Transcutaneous Electrical Joint Stimulation Devices (TEJSD) (HCPCS code E0762) meets the requirements to be considered reasonable and necessary for the treatment of osteoarthritis or any other condition. Claims for TEJSD (code E0762) will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>There is insufficient published clinical evidence to establish that treatment with other electro-magnetic devices such as transcutaneous electrical stimulation devices (TENS), neuromuscular stimulators (NMES), functional electrical stimulators (FES), light treatment devices (any type), infrared treatment devices (any type), etc. (not all-inclusive), singly or in any combination, meet the requirements to be considered reasonable and necessary for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Claims for these items will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>TEJSD COMBINED WITH AN ORTHOSIS (Brace)</p>\n<p>TEJSD is currently supplied as a stand-alone device or for use concurrently or in combination with a brace. Braces are separate DMEPOS items with independent coverage requirements that are unrelated to the coverage of TEJSD. When TEJSD is used concurrently or in combination with any type of brace, there no reimbursement possible for the TEJSD device. Refer to the applicable LCD and related Policy Article for information about the payment requirements for reimbursement of braces.</p>\n<p>ACCCESSORIES / SUPPLIES</p>\n<p>Claims for supplies used with a base item are not payable when the base item is not covered. Since code E0762 is not considered to be reasonable and necessary (see above), claims for codes A4465, A4495, A4557, and A4595 to be used with code E0762 will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of effectiveness of a TEJSD (E0762) when used with a conductive garment (E0731). Claims for code E0731 billed for use with an E0762 will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>CODING</p>\n<p>Refer to the related Policy Article CODING GUIDELINES section for additional information regarding coding of E0762.</p>\n<p>GENERAL</p>\n<p>A Standard Written Order (SWO) must be communicated to the supplier before a claim is submitted. If the supplier bills for an item addressed in this policy without first receiving a completed SWO, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) base items that require a Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD), the supplier must have received a signed SWO before the DMEPOS item is delivered to a beneficiary. If a supplier delivers a DMEPOS item without first receiving a WOPD, the claim shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Refer to the LCD-related Policy Article, located at the bottom of this policy under the Related Local Coverage Documents section.</p>\n<p>For DMEPOS base items that require a WOPD, and also require separately billed associated options, accessories, and/or supplies, the supplier must have received a WOPD which lists the base item and which may list all the associated options, accessories, and/or supplies that are separately billed prior to the delivery of the items. In this scenario, if the supplier separately bills for associated options, accessories, and/or supplies without first receiving a completed and signed WOPD of the base item prior to delivery, the claim(s) shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>An item/service is correctly coded when it meets all the coding guidelines listed in CMS HCPCS guidelines, LCDs, LCD-related Policy Articles, or DME MAC articles. Claims that do not meet coding guidelines shall be denied as not reasonable and necessary/incorrectly coded.</p>\n<p>Proof of delivery (POD) is a Supplier Standard and DMEPOS suppliers are required to maintain POD documentation in their files.

Continuous irrigation as a primary preventative measure (i.e., no history of obstruction) will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Documentation must substantiate the medical necessity of catheter irrigation and in particular continuous irrigation as opposed to intermittent irrigation. The records must also indicate the rate of solution administration and the duration of need.

A4353 should not be used for billing if the components are packaged separately rather than together as a kit. Separately provided components do not provide the equivalent degree of sterility achieved with an A4353. If separate components are provided instead of a kit (A4353) they will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Use of a Coude (curved) tip catheter (A4352) in female beneficiaries is rarely reasonable and necessary. When a Coude tip catheter is used (either male or female beneficiaries), there must be documentation in the beneficiary's medical record of the medical necessity for that catheter. An example would be the inability to catheterize with a straight tip catheter. This documentation must be available upon request. If documentation is requested and does not substantiate medical necessity, claims will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.<br><br><strong> EXTERNAL CATHETERS/URINARY COLLECTION DEVICES</strong> <br><br>Male external catheters (condom-type) or female external urinary collection devices are covered for beneficiaries who have permanent urinary incontinence when used as an alternative to an indwelling catheter.</p>\n<p>The utilization of male external catheters (A4349) generally should not exceed 35 per month.

For DMEPOS products that are supplied as refills to the original order, suppliers must contact the beneficiary prior to dispensing the refill and not automatically ship on a pre-determined basis, even if authorized by the beneficiary. This shall be done to ensure that the refilled item remains reasonable and necessary, existing supplies are approaching exhaustion, and to confirm any changes or modifications to the order. Contact with the beneficiary or designee regarding refills must take place no sooner than 14 calendar days prior to the delivery/shipping date. For delivery of refills, the supplier must deliver the DMEPOS product no sooner than 10 calendar days prior to the end of usage for the current product. This is regardless of which delivery method is utilized.</p>\n<p>For all DMEPOS items that are provided on a recurring basis, suppliers are required to have contact with the beneficiary or caregiver/designee prior to dispensing a new supply of items. Suppliers must not deliver refills without a refill request from a beneficiary. Items delivered without a valid, documented refill request will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p>Suppliers must not dispense a quantity of supplies exceeding a beneficiary's expected utilization. Suppliers must stay attuned to changed or atypical utilization patterns on the part of their clients. Suppliers must verify with the&nbsp;treating practitioner that any changed or atypical utilization is warranted.</p>\n<p>Regardless of utilization, a supplier must not dispense more than a three (3) - month quantity at a time.</p></span>\n\t\t\t\t"
